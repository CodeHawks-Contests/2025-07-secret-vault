## 🚨 Critical Security Issues Summary

### CRITICAL-01: Complete Access Control Bypass
- **Impact**: Any user can set secrets, only hardcoded owner can retrieve
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent access control between `set_secret` and `get_secret`
- **Status**: 🔴 **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FIX**

### CRITICAL-02: Resource Overwrite Vulnerability  
- **Impact**: Users cannot update secrets after initial set
- **Root Cause**: `move_to` fails if resource already exists
- **Status**: 🔴 **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FIX**

## 📊 Audit Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Lines of Code** | 59 total (30 nSLOC) |
| **Functions Analyzed** | 2 public functions |
| **Test Coverage** | ~10% (severely inadequate) |
| **Critical Issues** | 2 |
| **Total Issues** | 8 |
| **Risk Level** | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |

## 🎯 Key Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Phase 1)
1. **Fix Access Control**: Implement proper owner-only access for `set_secret`
2. **Fix Resource Management**: Handle existing vault resources properly
3. **Align Logic**: Make access patterns consistent between functions
4. **Add Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error codes

### Security Enhancements (Phase 2)
1. **Input Validation**: Add secret length and format validation
2. **Enhanced Events**: Include contextual information in events
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement security-focused test suite
4. **Documentation**: Add proper function documentation

## 🔧 Environment Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Aptos CLI
curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3

# Verify installation
